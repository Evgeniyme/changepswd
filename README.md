In our company, we are using teams generic accounts for Jira, Confluence, etc. Also, our Active directory is integrated into the Jira. So, if someone leaves the company and knew the password from these generic accounts, SA department should change the password and send a new one for users. The script will change the password and sent it automatically. 

Our mail server accepts the connection from the domain controller without authentication
